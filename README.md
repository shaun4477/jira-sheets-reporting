# Jira Sprint Reporting for Google Sheets

## What is this?

This is a simple Google Apps Script extension for Google Sheets that generates Sprint related reporting information for Jira Software Scrum boards. 

## Why?

There's no easy way in Jira Software to report across multiple boards or to export the exact same data shown in the Velocity and Sprint reports. 

## How to use? 

Install the add-on and wait for up to a minute for the 'Jira Reporting' menu bar item to appear. Once it does open the menu and choose 'Show reporting sidebar'

## Terms of Service

The extension uses no other APIs other than Google Sheets, Apps Script and Atlassian Jira APIs. Data is never transmitted anywhere except between G-Suite the configured Jira instance. 

We take no responsibility for your use of this service.
